## Changelog

#### Implemented login design (06/02/20)
- ##### Added
  - *Quicksand* (light, regular, medium, semibold, bold) and *FontAwesome 5* font files
  - `ViewManager` that manages scene changes in the app
  - `BaseController` that provides access to the app `Stage` and `lateInitialize()`
  - `LoginController` and LoginView for login and sign up
  - `PopupController` and PopupView for popups
  - Main css for styling

#### Initial implementation of transitions and animations (06/03/20)
- ##### Added
  - A Confirm Password field for signing up
  - Animations and transitions of various nodes in the Login view for switching between login and signup
  - Custom `Transitioner` classes for each node type
    - The initial idea here is to make the switching and animating between states of a node to be easier, and it should only take one line of code in the controller to do this.
    - However, problems will pop up when the same node type needs different kinds of animations, for different controllers/views. The codebase for this system will also go out of hand real quick. It's better to create the animations in the controller itself, where the animation is needed.
    - A class that stores common kinds of animations can be created later on, to try to prevent redundant code.
  - A `Vector` (aka Point) utility class
- ##### Modified
  - Login View made to be more fluid and less static
  - Login View included a Confirm Password field

#### Finished LoginView animations (06/04/20)
- ##### Added
  - An `Animator` class that stores all the animations associated with a specific node
    - Animations are differentiated by name, so when playing an animation, a name is required
    - Animations can be played in reverse
    - Animation rate can only be either -1 (reverse) or 1 (forward) for now
    - The event for when the animation finishes can also be assigned
    - Common time stamps in millis, depending on how fast the animations should be, are also statically stored 
  - A `Colors` class that stores all common colors based on the theme and style of the overall app 
- ##### Modified
  - `BaseController` now has an overridable method for initializing animations used in a controller
    - Keeps the `initialize` and `lateInitialize` methods clean, and aggregates all animation stuff in one method.
  - `LoginController` changed from using `Transitioners` to `Animators`
  - `ViewManager` now also runs a controller's `initializeAnimations` method
  - Login View is now made more fluid and dependent on the sizes of the control nodes
- ##### Removed
  - All the `Transitioner` classes
    - The codebase is more manageable and easier to understand using `Animator` instead

#### Implemented LoginView submit button animation (06/05/20)
- ##### Modified
  - The `Animator` class added two more common animation time stamps, VeryFast and SuperFast
  - `LoginController` added shadow animations to the Submit button to make it feel like it's hovering further up when hovered over by the mouse
  - `LoginController` also added color animations to the Submit button
  - `Colors` added a darkGreen color
  
#### First working implementation of the database system (06/05/20)
- ##### Added
  - `Column` annotation for specifying the database column name associated with an entity class' field
  - `Exclude` annotation to specify which fields in an entity class won't be tracked by the `DBSet`
  - `ForeignKey` annotation to specify which fields in an entity class are foreign keys
  - `Key` annotation to specify which fields in an entity class are primary keys
  - `Table` annotation to specify that a class is an entity class and to specify the table name in the database that this entity class maps to.
  - `DBConnection` class used to hold the database connection details and the `Connection` instance itself
  - `DBConnectionManager` class used to manage all the `DBConnection` instances used by the app
  - `DBContext` class used to hold all the `DBSet` objects 
  - `DBSet` class which uses generics and reflection to provide a CRUD implementation for any entity classes given to it
  - `FieldEntry` class used to hold metadata of both the fields in entity classes and columns in database tables
  - `NameValuePair` class used to pair a `String` name to some `Object` value
  - `IllegalEntityKeyFormatException` used to warn about multiple fields marked as autogenerated primary keys
  - `IllegalQueryResultSizeException` used to warn about redundant rows in the database, especially in the users table
  - `User` entity class used to represent an entity instance of the user table in the database
  - `ReflectionUtils` class used to help with reflection stuff in `DBSet` class
